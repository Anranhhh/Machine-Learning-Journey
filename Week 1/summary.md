# Week 1 Learning Summary

## What I Accomplished
- Installed and practiced using Jupyter Notebooks
- Learned basic NumPy operations: arrays, slicing, reshaping, random numbers
- Learned to use Pandas for data loading, inspection, and cleaning
- Practiced data visualization with matplotlib (bar charts, histograms, scatter plots)
- Completed a mini data analysis project using the Titanic dataset

---

## Key Takeaways
- Data cleaning and understanding the dataset are just as important as model building, as it is the basis for accurate and correct modeling.
- Visualizations are very helpful in finding patterns (e.g., gender vs survival).
- Real-world datasets are often messy (missing values, irregular columns) and need to be handled differently depending on the situation and needs of the problem that needs to be solved.

---

## Challenges I Faced
- At first, understanding how to group data by multiple attributes/columns (e.g., `groupby(['Sex', 'Pclass'])`) was tricky
- Figuring out which visualizations best represent the insights required some trial and error
- Learning syntax for chained Pandas operations (like `.groupby().agg()`) took practice

---

## What I Want to Improve
- Write cleaner, more organized code in notebooks
- Add more markdown explanations inside notebooks to improve readability
- Learn more about data preprocessing and feature selection for modeling

---

## Looking Ahead to Week 2
- Start training machine learning models using `scikit-learn`
- Learn concepts like train/test split, overfitting, and evaluation metrics
- Try a classification task (e.g., predicting survival from features)
