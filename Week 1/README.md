# Week 1 Project: Titanic Survival Data Analysis

This is a beginner-level data analysis project I completed as part of my Week 1 AI/ML learning journey. Using the Titanic passenger training dataset, I practiced key data science skills, including loading data, cleaning it, handling missing values, visualizing trends, and drawing basic insights.

---

## Skills Practiced
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `numpy_practice.ipynb` | NumPy basics exercises |
| `pandas_titanic_analysis.ipynb` | 1. Initial data loading and exploration. 2. Full analysis and visualization|
| `data_visualization.ipynb` | Visualizing age, survival rates, and more |
| `summary.md` | Reflection on Week 1 learning |

---

## Key Features
- Analyzed passenger survival by gender, class, and age
- Used grouped statistics and pivot tables
- Visualized survival patterns with bar charts and histograms

---

## Dataset Used
- Titanic Dataset from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- Iris Species Dataset from [UCIML Iris](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)

---

## Next Steps
In Week 2, I plan to:
- Train my first machine learning model using scikit-learn
- Predict Titanic survival using logistic regression
- Begin building reusable ML pipelines
